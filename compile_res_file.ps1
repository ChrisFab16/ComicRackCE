.SYNOPSIS
    Compiles a .rc file into a .res file using rc.exe, without hardcoding a
    Visual Studio version or edition.

.DESCRIPTION
    rc.exe isn't on PATH unless you're in a "Developer Command Prompt for VS".
    Instead of hardcoding a path like ".../2022/Enterprise/...", this script:

      1. Checks if rc.exe is already on PATH (fast path - e.g. when the
         GitHub Action 'ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd' already set up the environment).
      2. Otherwise, uses vswhere.exe (a stable path present since VS 2017,
         regardless of VS version/edition) to find ANY installed VS with the
         VC++ tools workload, then runs its VsDevCmd.bat to pick up rc.exe.

    This means the script keeps working when VS 2026 (or whatever comes
    next) is installed, with no edits required.

.PARAMETER RcFile
    Path to the .rc file to compile. Defaults to the ComicRack resources file.

.PARAMETER Arch
    Architecture to pass to VsDevCmd.bat. Defaults to x64.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Compile-Rc.ps1
    .\Compile-Rc.ps1 -RcFile ".\ComicRack\myressources.rc"

    [string]$RcFile = ".\ComicRack\myressources.rc",
